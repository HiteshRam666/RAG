## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔍 **Document Retrieval**: Finds relevant documents or passages based on user queries.
- 🤖 **Language Generation**: Generates high-quality responses using a language model, informed by retrieved documents.
- 💬 **Flexible Integration**: Easily adaptable for chatbots, FAQ systems, and Q&A applications.
- 📈 **Scalable**: Designed for high-performance information retrieval.

## 📚 Overview

RAG is designed to retrieve information from large databases and enhance response generation by grounding it in factual data. Perfect for applications where accuracy matters, RAG enables the generation of responses that are informed by real-world knowledge.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Retrieve**: The retrieval model selects relevant documents based on the query.
2. **Generate**: A generative model produces a response, grounded in the information from the retrieved documents.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prepare your data** (upload your document or knowledge base).
2. **Run the RAG model**
3. **View the results** to see the generated response based on retrieved documents.
